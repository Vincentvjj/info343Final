        <h3>Maria's Story</h3>

        <section id="maria-slide-1" class="container-fluid" data-parallax="scroll" data-speed="0.1">
            <h4>Hi There!</h4>
            <p>I left Mexico when I was sixteen. There [Wisconsin] I met my husband, I had my kids. I was eleven, almost twelve
                years there. When I was pregnant for my last kid, the border patrol picked me up and my mistake was that I did not
                argue my case. My husband had been deported and a lawyer told me that I had a 50-50 chance of winning or losing,
                and I decided not to argue it. And I let them to deport me, thinking that back in Mexico I would do okay. So I was
                deported, and I came back to Mexico with my kids. I was here for about four years. Then my husband tried to cross
                back and he made it through. And then I sent my kids, thinking I would follow. All three [of my children] were born
                in the US. So when they were in vacation here, I sent them to the US so they could go to school. And now I tried to
                cross as well, and I couldn’t. They picked me up. I was detained for three months. And I was just released, just now.
                This is the first time since fifteen years that I tried to cross the border again. And then I was deported. I had
                been deported three, four years ago, and I’m trying again now.</p>

            <h4>Peeling Nopales</h4>
            <p>Oh, here we’re peeling the nopales and I don’t know how to do that and she knows how to do it and she said she
                does like a hundred of these back in her place and she was teaching me how to do it.  So, they’re my friends
                and they were- I met them here as I was leaving and then the next picture is of the detail of peeling of the
                nopales.  Taking off all the thorns.  So I tell them, “If I’m going to make a living out of that I’ll die” because
                I could just peel one in the time that it took her to peel five.</p>

            <h4>My Friend’s Daughters</h4>
            <p>These are the daughters of this woman from Honduras.  She came yesterday and they are the exact same age as my
                daughters.  This one has six and the other one has ten.  And they are the daughters of this woman from Honduras
                who is at the shelter.  She is staying with the nuns.  She was very nice and the girls are very, very friendly.
                And they remind me of my daughters.
                They wanted to have their pictures and they really liked their pictures and talking with them- yes, they are
                just like my daughters.  One blames the other and one teases the other and one says that she is the one who
                behaves well and the other one does not and just like kids and so that’s why I took a picture of them.  Just
                thinking of my daughters.</p>

            <h4>View Through The Window</h4>
            <p>This is through a little hole on the window.  I’m taking a picture of outside.  This is the window of the shelter
                where I am staying.  That’s the place. Well, this this makes me think of my town, my village.  It’s not that it’s like
                this but it has trees and it has the houses and it just makes me think of that.</p>

            <h4>The Peaceful Landscape!</h4>
            <p>This is the same landscape but it is not through the window because I went outside.  I was no longer inside.  I went
                outside and took the same picture of the outside without the window.  I don’t know, I like this because it gives me a
                sense of peace, it’s very peaceful, I can breathe the peace of this landscape and it makes me think of my village and
                its very peaceful there and it’s not like a city it’s like a small village.  So this picture makes me think of that and
                my family.  Yes, my dad is there in the village.</p>

            <h4>The Super Hero Bus</h4>
            <p>That bus has a super hero drawn on it, except that when I was taking the picture the bus was leaving.  So the bus was
                leaving already when I was taking the picture.
                Interviewer: And why did you want to take that picture?
                Respondent: You mean of the super hero? Well, because when I saw it I thought of my son.  And when you’re a kid, you would
                like to believe really in super heros and everything they do and so that is what I was remembering, that we have to be strong
                because super heros doen’t exist.  They don’t exist and we’re realty on our own.  We have to have our own goal.  I have to have
                my own goal that is to be with my kids.  If I were a super hero.  I would go flying all the way to my kids but I cannot do that.
                So that’s why I took the picture, because of that super hero.</p>

            <h4>So What Are You Going To Do Now?</h4>
            <p>I don’t know. I’m between a rock and a hard place, between the sword and the wall. If I stay here, well, that would be better, but it would be
                turning my back on my kids. And I cannot do that, because they’re my life. But if I try to go back and they catch me and they keep me in detention
                for a year, well, I don’t want that either, because then I won’t be able to be with my kids either. So I don’t know, I don’t know what I’m going to do.
                And to my village, I don’t want to go back there. There’s no work there.It’s only agriculture and there’s no work. So I don’t want to go back there. So I don’t know.</p>
