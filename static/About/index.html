            <p><b>Photo Stories:</b> life stories of the oppressed and the marginalized. Life stories of immigrant day laborers at
                Casa Latina and at Centro El Comedor will help surface the richness, diversity and depth of their roots, experiences,
                and aspirations. As an example of what de Souza Santos calls Sociology of Emergence, this project will offer a
                counter-narrative that demonstrate the power of their determination and re-valorizes their human dignity and their
                contribution to society.</p>

            <p>Thousands of people cross or attempt to cross the border from Mexico to the US every year. Many are returned
               at the border, many others make it through and start a new life as immigrants in different US cities. These
               individuals are human beings with their own identities, dreams, aspirations, and struggles. Through this project
               we seek to highlight and re-value their life experiences and their views of culture and identity, as expressed
               in photography and stories. While offering tools and a space for reflection to immigrant day laborers, recently
               deported immigrants, and prospective immigrants to the US, we will explore how the reality of their present
               circumstance, as well as their larger culture and identity, is self-expressed through the photos they take and
               the stories they tell.</p>
