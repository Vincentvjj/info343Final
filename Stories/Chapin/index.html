                    <h4>The Begining</h4>
                    <p>So this first one is when you gave me the camera. I was with my friend and so we took some pictures that are
                        some memories to remember that there’s friends who want to be friends with me. Here I took my first pictures
                        with my friend.</p>

                    <h4>The Basketball Court</h4>
                    <p>This is the basketball court, and the basketball court is something that I’m a very big fan of. I play a lot
                        of basketball. In Guatemala, I would wake up really early at 5 in the morning, until 9 in the morning I would
                        play basketball. And then I would come back at 4 in the afternoon and play until 9 o’clock at night. That was
                        my passion to play basketball.
                        I see it and it just gives me anxiety because I don’t have a basketball and they don’t have one. I’ve asked for
                        one and they don’t have one. And so I’m very anxious. I haven’t been playing basketball for a month and that’s
                        really my sport. I really like it. I would like to play it again here. But I don’t have a ball, so well, I’ll
                        just… my feet are itchy. I want to play and I want to be having fun, but I cannot do it. So, I really like
                        basketball and I cannot play it. So that’s why I took that picture.</p>

                    <h4>My Friend</h4>
                    <p>And here I am with my other friend. I saw her here, and I met her here. And I wanted a picture with her because
                        I’m glad to see this person who helps me, and when you think that there’s nobody who will help you, there’s always
                        people who will help you. So as I’ve always said, if there’s a door that closes, you also have another door that
                        opens. Five doors closed, you’ll have five doors open. There’s always somebody willing to help you, and you can help
                        others too. So there I am with Natalya.
                        And we’re all together. We’re the same. If I was discriminated against anybody, I would not be talking with you or
                        discriminate against anybody. I don’t like discriminating. Rather than that, if I can give people love and I can
                        share something, hey, I have something to share, I’ll give you a bit of what I have. That’s what I like, to be able
                        to share what I have and what I do.</p>

                    <h4>My Hair Cut </h4>
                    <p>And this one here is when I’m cutting my hair. So here, this first picture is when I still have my hair long and I was
                        about to have it cut, so I had a picture before and then I had my hair cut, and there’s other pictures with my hair cut,
                        and look how it changes. Now my hair is very short here. So I cut my hair, and I was going to have a shower. So look here,
                        look how short I have the hair now. So I was taking pictures of what I was doing that day. So that’s it. I was going to have
                        a haircut, I was going to have a shower. That’s the things I was doing that day. So I cut my hair. I wasn’t thinking of cutting
                        my hair, but I did it. And now I have the pictures of before and after. And now I have some pictures, and that’s really cool.</p>

                    <h4>The Landscape</h4>
                    <p>Well, I see this landscape, and here you can see a light. This is the wall. And you cannot cross over to the US. And there’s a road,
                        and then there’s a light. But it’s a picture I take. It’s like a piece of art. It’s not just a stupid thing, it’s a piece of art.
                        Question: And how do you feel about being in this side of the wall?
                        Well, I feel okay, I feel relaxed knowing that I have my dream. I have a new goal, a new objective, a new place that I’m experiencing,
                        a new step that I have to take. That is for me being here in Mexico, to be here thinking about that.

                    <h4>The Wall</h4>
                    <p>So here, this is the wall. The next one is the wall. This one is the wall and there’s a light behind it. And here this picture I took it
                        because there’s barriers, there’s obstacles, but sometimes the problems… we see the problems like I’m seeing this wall now. It’s huge.
                        You know that there’s this huge, very tall wall, and you cannot cross it. And as a person sometimes you look at the problems and you see
                        them, the situations, sometimes the rent or the pay of utilities, and you see it and it’s huge like this. It’s very big, and I cannot make it.
                        And sometimes we’re looking at it like this, but if you see at the other end, at the end, there is a light. And if you pay attention,
                        when you look at the wall, you can see the wall is very small if you plant yourself well in the ground and you know that you’re going to cross.
                        You can see that wall is something really small in relation to everything else you’re going to have in your life. That’s why I took this picture.
                        I don’t take the pictures just for anything. I take them for a purpose. Like, sometimes, we see a big problem, but really if we look at it, it’s
                        a small problem and you can resolve it without having too much fuss. But that’s why I like this picture. I took this picture because I also wanted
                        my family to see the picture of seeing the wall.</p>
