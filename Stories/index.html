            <h4>Peeling Nopales</h4>
            <p>Oh, here we’re peeling the nopales and I don’t know how to do that and she knows how to do it and she said she does
                like a hundred of these back in her place and she was teaching me how to do it.  So, they’re my friends and they
                were- I met them here as I was leaving and then the next picture is of the detail of peeling of the nopales.
                Taking off all the thorns.  So I tell them, “If I’m going to make a living out of that I’ll die” because I could just
                peel one in the time that it took her to peel five.</p>
            <h4>My Friend’s Daughters</h4>
            <p>These are the daughters of this woman from Honduras.  She came yesterday and they are the exact same age as my daughters.
                This one has six and the other one has ten.  And they are the daughters of this woman from Honduras who is at the shelter.
                She is staying with the nuns.  She was very nice and the girls are very, very friendly.  And they remind me of my daughters.
                They wanted to have their pictures and they really liked their pictures and talking with them- yes, they are just like my
                daughters.  One blames the other and one teases the other and one says that she is the one who behaves well and the other
                one does not and just like kids and so that’s why I took a picture of them.  Just thinking of my daughters.</p>
            <h4>View Through the Hole on the Window </h4>
            <p>This is through a little hole on the window.  I’m taking a picture of outside.  This is the window of the shelter where I am
                staying.  That’s the place. Well, this this makes me think of my town, my village.  It’s not that it’s like this but it has
                trees and it has the houses and it just makes me think of that.</p>
            <h4>The Peaceful Landscape!</h4>
            <p>This is the same landscape but it is not through the window because I went outside.  I was no longer inside.  I went outside
                and took the same picture of the outside without the window.  I don’t know, I like this because it gives me a sense of peace,
                it’s very peaceful, I can breathe the peace of this landscape and it makes me think of my village and its very peaceful there
                and it’s not like a city it’s like a small village.  So this picture makes me think of that and my family.  Yes, my dad is
                there in the village.</p>
            <h4>The Super Hero Bus</h4>
            <p>That bus has a super hero drawn on it, except that when I was taking the picture the bus was leaving.  So the bus was leaving
                already when I was taking the picture.
                Interviewer: And why did you want to take that picture?
                Respondent: You mean of the super hero? Well, because when I saw it I thought of my son.  And when you’re a kid, you would like
                to believe really in super heros and everything they do and so that is what I was remembering, that we have to be strong because
                super heros don’t exist.  They don’t exist and we’re realty on our own.  We have to have our own goal.  I have to have my own goal
                that is to be with my kids.  If I were a super hero.  I would go flying all the way to my kids but I cannot do that.  So that’s
                why I took the picture, because of that super hero.</p>

            <h4>My Friends From Shelter</h4>
            <p>Theses are pictures I took with my friends over lunch. I was staying with one of them here.  The one in the middle, in the room,
                in the detention center, the CCA, I was with her for about two weeks.  And the others, well, I met them when they released us.
                There’s like six locations, I was in one and they were in the others and the others, there were more, but the others left and
                here we met again.  We were staying in the sam shelter here now.  So these are my friends.  That’s when you see well, since we’re
                Mexican then we support each other, even though we don’t know each other well we know we’re in the same boat, we have the same goals.
                Well, of these two I don’t know but this one I know she has her children in the US and she’s trying to cross because of them, her
                children.  So, we’re women and we’re mothers and we’re Mexican and even though we don’t know each other and even though we don’t
                know who is who that unites us.  </p>
